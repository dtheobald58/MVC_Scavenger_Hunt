Youtube kind of seems to have a format that works similarly to MVC allowing people to create accounts and then subscribe/follow
other users/accounts.

The model would be used to keep track of what subscribers an account has and what accounts they subscribe to, comments and 
ratings of videos, and possibly for storing uploaded videos as well.

The controllers could contain algorithms and logic to choose trending videos to suggest and recent uploads from accounts you are
following.

The views are used to display thumbnails and titles from videos, comments and ratings on videos, who you are subscribed to, and who
is subscribed to you.
